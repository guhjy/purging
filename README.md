# `purging` for mediation effects

#### Simple method for eliminating mediating impacts among independent variables

Though there are some great packages for mediation analysis out there, the simple intuition of its need is often lost, especially on younger graduate students. Thus, this is set of files provides a quick, intuitive overview of mediation and the need for "purging" variables for use in analysis.

Let's say we had a causal model where womens' level of labor force participation determines their level of contraceptive use, and that the effect of female labor force participation on fertility is indirect, essentially filtered through its impact on contraceptive use. Once we account for contraceptive use, the direct effect of labor force participation (seen in the simple bivariate model, _labor.model_) goes away.

This is a simple way of thinking about mediation effects (e.g., a Mediation model:  LABOR (indirect) -> CONTRACEPT (direct) -> FERTILITY). If we run into this, a simple solution is to first regress contraceptive use on labor force participation. Then, we store those residuals. Then, we add the stored residuals as their own "variable" in the updated model specification. When we do this, we will see that each variable is explaining difference variable in the DV of interest. See the attached code file for the example; I thank Scott Basinger and Patrick Shea for the base of the example and data in their stats labs.

Data overview from Scott's lab, is a small dataset from the 2005 United Nations Human Development report (all data are from 2003). Variables include: Human Development Index (HDI) (combining female life expectancy at birth (Life), educational attainment, and income per capita); fertility rate (Fert: births per adult female); percentage of women using contraception (Cont); tech adoption as share of the population using cell phones (Cell: subscribers per 1000 people) and the share of the population using the internet (Inter: subscribers per 1000 people); per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in US dollars; carbon dioxide emissions per capita (CO2) measured in metric tons; female adult literacy rate (Liter); and finally adult women in the labor force per 100 men (FemEc).
